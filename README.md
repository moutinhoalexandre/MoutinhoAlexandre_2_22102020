# Reservia

"Reservia" is the second project I'm working on as part of my training with OpenClassrooms.

In this scenario, I am a trainee in a company that offers a holiday planning tool.

The mission I was given was to integrate the graphic model using only HTML and CSS, with certain technical constraints and functionalities.


# Specifications

- Integration must be done in HTML5 & CSS3
- The search field must be an input field, the text of which can be edited. However, the search functionality must not be implemented.
- Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. For the time being the links will be empty.
- Filters, although not functional, should change style on hovering.
In the menu, the "Accommodation" and "Activities" links are anchors that should lead to the sections of the page.
- Even if no mock-up for the tablet resolution is provided, the integration must support it and is left to the discretion of the developer.
- The images must be of adequate size so that it looks as good as possible with the least possible impact on the page loading time.
- The code must use semantic tags and must not contain any errors or warnings to the [W3C HTML et CSS validator](https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmoutinhoalexandre.github.io%2FMoutinhoAlexandre_2_22102020%2F%23&ucn_task=conformance#).
- The site must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
- The HTML and CSS must be separated and the folder must be organised.
- The code must be versioned with git and must have a remote repo on Github or Gitlab.


## Technical constraints

- The model for the computer and telephone resolutions is given to us.
- All images on the site are also delivered in small, medium, large & xlarge format.
- The icons come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- The colours are: blue #0065FC - light blue #DEEBFF - grey #F2F2F2
- The police are ["Raleway"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)
